We had the need to ingest data from Workday, which in order to have full functionality - required integration with our Workday SOAP API. Because of the deeply-nested and complex structures of this data, performing schema development of these data structures would be best suited progromatically. I developed a WSDL to SparkSchema interpreter that could convert the SOAP API data structures to Delta-compatible SparkSchemas at runtime. This functionality resulted in the enablement of processing SOAP API data sources and vastly increased developer efficiency by doing so progromatically.",

I implemented IaC as Azure Bicep in order to manage this infrastructure. The result was scalably managed resources that provided platform stability, developer efficiency, enhanced security and reduced costs through management.

I developed an end-to-end cost management analytics solution in Databricks in order to quantify the costs of individual data assets.

We also had many data science teams that were also deploying their own resources onto our infrastructure in the form of DABs. We had the need to standardize our deployment processes across platform and our user base to enforce platform ideologies and technical design. I architected and implemented a Jenkins Shared Library that acted as a delegated deployment process for Terraform and DABs deployments which allowed any platform user to securely implement platform resources in a standardized manner. This was a organizational-wide effort that spanned across the entirety of engineering at DraftKings. For MLP, it enabled deoupling of code and CICD systems, secured deployments via centralized authentication mechanisms, extended capabilities by offering extensible, modularized services, and enabled users to self-serve automation. This ultimately increased developer efficiency and DevEx across all platform users by allowing them to focus on platform context as opposed to deployment MLOps processes.",

We needed a method to stabilize our runtime environments in order to minimize this variance. I developed and implemented a strategy that mirrored official Databricks Runtimes in in devcontainers and implement package pinning. CICD pipelines would then leverage these project devcontainers to perform static analysis, testing, and deployment operations. The result of these improvements were consistent development environments which mirrored production runtimes, allowing us to take advantage of the production runtimes that Databricks manages on our behalf and have consistency in development and CICD.

Specifically, recommendations I made included - reduction in Scrum standup ceremonies, initiative ownership/single point of authority, kanban process mirroring, backlog task prioritization, issue templates, democratized story pointing, ideation saga, and ticket tagging.
